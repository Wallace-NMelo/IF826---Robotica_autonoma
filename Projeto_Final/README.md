# Line-based Kalman Filter for Robot Localization

### How to run:
- Open the scene `scene_final.ttt` on CoppeliaSim
- Start simulation
- Run the `main.py` file


### Results:
- In the main.py we are printing the error between Odometry position position and Estimated position.
- To show the results obtained through the split-and-merge algorithm we put some images, in the **Extracted Points** folder from lines extracted by Lidar.
